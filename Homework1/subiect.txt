Optional homework – implementation operations + conversions 

share in the final grade: 10% 
deadline for homework submission: the second week of December 2015

The application must implement algorithms for: 
arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by one digit, in a base p{2,3,...,9,10,16}
conversions of natural numbers between two bases p,q{2,3,...,9,10,16} using the substitution method or successive divisions and rapid conversions between two bases p,q{2, 4, 8, 16}.
and  must have a menu such that all operations and conversion methods to be verified separately.

The executable form, the code of the application and the documentation will be written on a CD (one CD for each group, in which every student will have a personal folder). The documentation will follow the same structure as the Programming Fundament’s documentations, and it must contain at least: the problem statement for the implemented application, the used algorithms in pseudo-code, implementation considerations and test data. 
The mark is computed as follows:
10%: by default
70% : the application (the authors name will be found in code and will be visible at run too)
1p - algorithm for the method of successive divisions 
1p - algorithm for the substitution method 
1p – algorithm for conversion using 10 as an intermediate base
2p - rapid conversions (executable form) between two bases p,q{2, 4, 8, 16}.
1p addition of two numbers in a base
1p subtraction of two numbers in a base
1p multiplication of a number by a digit in a base
1p division of a number by a digit in a base
1p code quality (indentation, use of comments, suggestive variables names)
20%: documentation 
1p problem statement
1p sub-algorithm’s diagram
1p used data type specification
3p specification and pseudo-code for the important algorithms used (input, output, preconditions, post-conditions -1p; pseudo-code 2p)
3p at least a set of test data for the complete application, more data sets where is needed
1p documentation clearness (structured, well written, ...)
NOTE: If the electronic homework is at least 80% similar (http://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/string_similarity/) to another one from this year or a previous year of study, the electronic homework will not be corrected at all (neither the documentation), and the corresponding points are lost.
